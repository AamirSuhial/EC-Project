# AWS SDK for Node.js Sample Project

A simple Node.js application illustrating usage of the AWS SDK for Node.js.

## Requirements

The only requirement of this application is the Node Package Manager. All other
dependencies (including the AWS SDK for Node.js) can be installed with:

    npm install

## Basic Configuration

You need to set up your AWS security credentials before the sample code is able
to connect to AWS. You can do this by creating a file named "credentials" at ~/.aws/ 
(C:\Users\USER_NAME\.aws\ for Windows users) and saving the following lines in the file:

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <your access key id>
    aws_secret_access_key = <your secret key>

See the [Security Credentials](http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials) page.
It's also possible to configure your credentials via a configuration file or
directly in source. See the AWS SDK for Node.js [Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/node-configuring.html)
for more information.

## install gcloud => https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install
create a project from console
then initialize your credential with
gcloud init

## Running the S3 sample

This sample application connects to Amazon's [Simple Storage Service (S3)](http://aws.amazon.com/s3),
creates a bucket, and uploads a file to that bucket. The script will automatically
create the file to upload. All you need to do is run it:

    node sample.js

The S3 documentation has a good overview of the [restrictions for bucket names](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html)
for when you start making your own buckets.
